 Led a three-member team through the full data-science lifecycle on a 89 k-professor RateMyProfessor dataset, designing a Python pipeline (Pandas/NumPy/SciPy/sk-learn) that cleaned, normalized and integrated 90 + numeric, categorical and text-tag variables. Applied permutation tests, Mann-Whitney U and bootstrap CIs (α = 0.005) to quantify a small but significant pro-male bias in average ratings (Δ = 0.067, d ≈ 0.06) and variance, while confirming no practical gender gap in perceived difficulty. Engineered multicollinearity-checked linear regressions (numeric features → R² = 0.73, RMSE = 0.38; tag features → R² = 0.75) that highlighted “Take Class Again” and “Good Feedback/Amazing Lectures” as dominant drivers of teaching quality, and built a SMOTE-balanced logistic model that predicts the coveted “pepper” honor with AUC = 0.67—outperforming random-forest and baseline benchmarks. Deliverables included fully commented code, publication-ready visuals, and a 10-question analytical report, underscoring my ability to turn an open-ended academic brief into statistically rigorous, production-grade insights.
